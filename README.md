# Xinu on Beagle Bone Black

This project is where I will track my progress through building [Xinu](https://xinu.cs.purdue.edu/) from scratch while reading [Operating System Design: The Xinu Approach (Second Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Design-Approach-Second/dp/1498712436).


# Set up
This project assumes a [BeagleBone Black](https://beagleboard.org/black) as the build target and a debian based linux machine as where the build happens. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/jarrocha/XinuBBB/blob/main/README.md) to get setup.

# Compiling
TODO (I haven't received my BeagleBone Black yet, so I have not even done my own set up yet)

# Running
TODO
